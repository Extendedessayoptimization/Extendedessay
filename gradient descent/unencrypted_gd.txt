the artist is the creator of beautiful things.  to reveal art and
conceal the artist is art's aim.  the critic is he who can translate
into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful
things.

the highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.
those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without
being charming.  this is a fault.

those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the
cultivated.  for these there is hope.  they are the elect to whom
beautiful things mean only beauty.

there is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book.  books are well
written, or badly written.  that is all.

the nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of caliban seeing
his own face in a glass.
